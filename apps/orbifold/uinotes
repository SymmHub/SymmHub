Notes on UI


Three basic interfaces:

Mouse actions on canvas
	if domain highlighted:
		click outside turns off domain
	domain parameters highlighted, domain highlighted
	passing over domain params highlights them
	mousewheel changes length, twist
	clicking on a cone point bumps it up or down
	clicking and dragging moves texture
	controls on side scale and rotate texture
	later: can brush boundary of the domain


panel
	choose from groups:
	345
	2345
	23x
	2o
	2xx

	load input image/choose input image
